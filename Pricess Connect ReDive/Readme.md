This mod brings you civilization "Princess Connect! Re:Dive" and three leaders of the Gourmet Edifice: Pecorine, Kyaru, and Kokkoro

Unique District: Guild Clan, which replaces commercial hub and unlocks special district project "Clan Battle".

Unique Unit: Princess Knight, and Princess Archer. They are melee and ranged unit from medieval era, and unlocked by specific civics.

Unique Ability: Adventure Quest, gives you combat bonuses against barbarians and city-states. It also provides you gold and culture every time you defeat an enemy unit.

This mod also contains BGMs from Princess Connect! Re:Dive game and anime albums. There's 18 songs in total. I hope you'll enjoy them and have a good time☆

Game Highlights
Compatible with all Expansions
And works with the vanilla Civ6 too... though playing with Gathering Storm will offer you the best experience.

City Names that Never Run Out
The mod includes 35 unique Princess Connect city names, from guilds names to quest names on the map... so you'll never see that "Washington" when founding your cities.

Unique Geological Names (GS)
Names of various rivers, lakes, mountains... on continent Astraea are added into the game for you to explore. (in Gathering Storm only)

All Three Leaders Can Be on the Map in One Game
Having Pecorine, Kyaru, and Kokkoro in the same game is not only possible, but also one of the recommended ways to play -- this is enabled by the plentiful city names and civilian names that almost never collides with each other.
Most AI's scripts in the diplomatic screen are directly quoted from the Princess Connect! Re:Dive game. Interacting with AIs will feel just like playing Princess Connect! Re:Dive.
