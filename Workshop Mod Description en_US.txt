This mod brings you civilization "Princess Connect! Re:Dive" and three leaders of the Gourmet Edifice: Pecorine, Kyaru, and Kokkoro (ペコリーヌ, キャル, コッコロ).

Unique District: Guild Clan, which replaces commercial hub and unlocks special district project "Clan Battle".

Unique Unit: Princess Knight and Princess Archer. They are melee and ranged units from the medieval era, and are unlocked by specific civics.

Unique Ability: Adventure Quest, gives you combat bonuses against barbarians and city-states. It also provides you gold and culture every time you defeat an enemy unit.

This mod also contains BGM from Princess Connect! Re:Dive game and anime albums. There are 18 songs in total. I hope you'll enjoy them and have a good time☆

[h1]Game Highlights[/h1][list]
[*][b]Compatible with all Expansions[/b]
And works with the vanilla Civ6 too... though playing with Gathering Storm will offer you the best experience.

[*][b]City Names that Never Run Out[/b]
The mod includes 45 unique Princess Connect city names, from guilds names to quest names on the map... [strike]so you'll never see that "Washington" when founding your cities.[/strike]

[*][b]Unique Geological Names (GS)[/b]
Names of various rivers, lakes, mountains... on continent Astraea are added into the game for you to explore. (in Gathering Storm only)

[*][b]All Three Leaders Can Be on the Map in One Game[/b]
Having Pecorine, Kyaru, and Kokkoro in the same game is not only possible, but also one of the recommended ways to play.
Most AI's scripts in the diplomatic screen are directly quoted from the Princess Connect! Re:Dive game. Interacting with AIs will feel just like playing the original game.[/list]
